Reddit User Post History.

Little code i wrote in Java with Eclipe, if you would like to search 
For any user post history, import the project to any Java workbench, insert "YOUR_DESIRED_USERNAME " as a string 
to the only function in the Main class, there is even an example in Main class.
You can also use it for you own purpose like to monitor a reddit user for FUN.
Thanks.

you'll have to use Gson Library https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.code.gson/gson
